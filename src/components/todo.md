TODO - short term
- Ability to set timer inbetween sets from the logger
- Ability to add notes for specific exercises from logger
    - When logging a set, show notes from most recent set
- Ability to add notes to entire day?


TODO - long term
- Make it easy to quick log an exercise from home? Perhaps a change in UI here but not sure what?
- data vis of progressive overload
- Want to be able to have better info for various rep ranges. For example if I'm hitting hip thrusts with a 15-20 rep range seeing my last workout at a 6-10 rep range won't inform me. So maybe adding the ability to specify rep ranges from logger to view history for? Need to think more about this one
- A "today" screen that pulls data from apple health & shows your workouts + step count.
